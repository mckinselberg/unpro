            <h2>1999-2008</h2>
            <p class="bio">
              Formed in 1999 somewhere between Bethlehem, Pa and West Orange, NJ, The Unpronounceable entertained
              thousands...er...at least a thousand fans with its tribute to those lost years when Elvis sang Hank
              Williams tunes with Black Sabbath while Duke &amp; Satchmo called out the changes.&nbsp; They called it
              COUNTRIFUNKED JAZZABILLY, but it&rsquo;s really just what rock &amp; roll would&rsquo;ve been if it
              hadn&rsquo;t wasted all that time on hairspray.<br /><br />
              The members included vocalist/guitarist/upright-bassist Pete Gustavson (Jorge Beefalo),
              guitarist/banjoist/upright-bassist Adam Gustavson (Chip Beefalo), guitarist/upright-bassist/pianist Dan
              Kinsley (Chet Beefalo) and drummers Phil Guidi (Chuck Beefalo), Justin Riddle (Charlamagne Beefalo) and
              Matt Scheller (Chugga Beefalo). The Unpronounceable's entire catalog was recorded, mixed and engineered by
              Rob Badenoch (Butch Beefalo). Sarah Wolfe (Delilah Beefalo) managed The Unpronounceable and Mogens Music
              business affairs.<br />
              <br />
              The Unpronounceable played its last show (kind of) in the Spring of 2008 at the mythical South Bethlehem
              epicenter of the Lehigh Valley Music Scene: The Funhouse. If you missed them there, you can console
              yourself here by downloading all of the albums for free on this website and playing them on repeat forever
              and always.
